# Movies Corner CLI Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Movies Corner CLI project! This project tests skills in Python, databases, and Command-Line Interface (CLI) design. It requires one to create a CLI application that solves a real-world problem, incorporates best practices, and showcases your understanding of key concepts learned in Phase 3.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>

2. Install project dependencies using Pipenv.
    pipenv install

3. Activate the virtual environment.
    pipenv shell

4. Run the CLI application.
    python3 seed.py

## Project Structure

- `seed.py`: Main CLI application and database seeding logic.
- `models.py`: SQLAlchemy models and database schema.
- `Pipfile`: Specifies project dependencies.

## Features

- CLI application with user prompts and options.
- Database schema created and modified using SQLAlchemy ORM.
- Virtual environment managed with Pipenv.
- Implementation of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) algorithm.
- Best practices in CLI design.

## Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the CLI. Options include creating users, displaying users, creating movies, displaying movies, and exiting the application.

## Tips

- Plan your database schema before starting to avoid migration issues.
- Keep Python, SQLAlchemy, and CLI scripts in separate modules.
- Validate user input in the CLI application.
- Provide detailed prompts and messages to guide the user.
